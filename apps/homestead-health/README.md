# Homestead · Health

**Family health records the household holds itself.** Module three on
**Homestead · Affairs**, sibling to `homestead-law` and `homestead-ledger`,
incubating here toward promotion to `rudi193-cmd/homestead-health` — the
law-gazelle → homestead-law path, walked again.

The design is
[`homestead/docs/PLAN-homestead-health.md`](https://github.com/rudi193-cmd/homestead/blob/main/docs/PLAN-homestead-health.md):
the packs (immunizations first — one pack proves the seam), the rungs field by
field, the module invariants H-1…H-5, and the five bites. This directory is
**bite 1 — the seat**: a module that pins the engine and proves the pin,
holding nothing else yet.

**Status: bite 1 built; bites 2–5 are pending claims.** H-1 through H-5 sit in
`tests/test_invariants_pending.py` as `xfail(strict=True)` — the suite stays
green while they are unbuilt and fails the moment an implementation quietly
satisfies one, forcing the test to be promoted rather than forgotten. The
seat's own guarantees (the pin is true and capped, nothing imports the
network, nothing listens, no second path resolver, no shadowed test basename)
are live tests in `tests/test_invariants_seat.py`.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q          # bare, from a cold checkout. No out-of-band install step.
```

> `homestead-affairs` is a pinned dependency consumed only through
> `homestead.keep`'s public API. Do not modify it, propose changes to it, or
> generalize app logic into it. Upstream changes are issues on
> [`rudi193-cmd/homestead`](https://github.com/rudi193-cmd/homestead).

**Synthetic data only.** No real household's health records enter this app
before the export/log story (bite 5) is built and audited — the engine's own
rule, and this module handles exactly the material the rung model calls `L4`.

Apache-2.0, matching the engine.
